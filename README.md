John Deere tractor driving simulator. The project uses SoCs to prototype the technologies integrated into a John Deere agricultural tractor. Buttons represents the Steering and Brake of the vehicle, switches the Gear Selection and a potentiometer for the Throttle. The SMT32 development board displays these values on an LCD display. Also, through the UART protocol, they are sent to a Raspberry Pi, which carries out its processing and graphing on a screen.
